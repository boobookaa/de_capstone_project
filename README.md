# Udacity Nanodegree Capstone Project
Please find the full description in the DataEngineering Capstone Project.pdf

Amazon sells tens and hundreds thousands of goods every day. After selling a customer can leave a review about the item purchased. All these reviews help other people to make the right choice. Also they can be used as an excellent source of data for marketing experts and other specialists from Amazon. Everyday customers generate huge amounts of data. So their analysis can be a bit complicated. Usually before the analysis data are cleared and transformed to the proper form. In many cases it means performing a lot of different operations and transformations. 
The goal of this capstone project is building an analytical Data Warehouse. Customer reviews have been chosen as a subject of analysis. 
The Data Warehouse can answer to the next questions:
How do ratings vary with different options, for example verified purchases, marketplaces or product categories
How have number of ratings changed over time
Are ratings helpful
Also it is possible to take a look at the reviewer behavior or provide sentiment analysis.
